# Sample-discord-bot
A discord bot made with python made to the bare minimum required to function.

Feel free to expand on this anytime as this is the amount needed to run it :D

Also I'm still experimenting on how to use VS code to change code on Github repos without cloning, so if you have any ideas, feel free to comment below. (That also might be why some code might work, but for a project this simple, it should be fine.)
